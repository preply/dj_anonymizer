# Contributing to dj_anonymizer

A checklist of things to remember when making a PR:
- Write tests if applicable
- Add note important changes in the [changelog](https://github.com/preply/dj_anonymizer/blob/master/docs/changelog.rst) file
- Update the README and documentation if needed

For test automation on CI, GitHub Actions are in use. You can also run the same tests locally, check Makefile contents or try `make help`.

Contributions following these guidelines are always welcome and appreciated!
